# Multiplayer Tag Game  

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to this project!  

This is a **multiplayer game** inspired by the classic childrenâ€™s tag game. One player becomes the **chaser**, while the others must run away and complete tasks before time runs out.  

- If you are a **chaser**: you cannot do tasks or interact with objects.  
- If you are a **runner**: you must finish your assigned tasks before the timer ends, while avoiding being tagged. 

Currently, Iâ€™m working on a **farm map** with interactive tasks. You can also check out a preview of harvesting! ðŸŒ±  

## âœ… Features Implemented  
- **Tagging system** with proper replication.  
- **Disabling interactions** with objects when a player becomes the catcher.  
- **Planting crops, harvesting crops**.  
- **Watering dry crops**, including animation and effects.  

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress  
- Additional **farm-related tasks**.  
- Expanded **maps** and new environments.  
- More **animations**, **UI** and visual polish.
